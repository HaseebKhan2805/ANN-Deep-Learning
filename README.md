# ANN-Deep-Learning
This repository hosts weekly labs for CS381 â€“ Artificial Neural Networks &amp; Deep Learning at NUTECH. It provides structured manuals, notebooks, and resources guiding students from perceptrons and backpropagation to advanced architectures such as CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, autoencoders, GANs, and transfer learning, culminating in a capstone project.
